### **_Description_**

A bitter rivalry has always existed between the Chum Bucket and the Krusty Krab. To finally put things to a rest Mr. Krabs hired some software developers to really drive home that his food was better than anything else.

This site is focused around reviewing the direct menu items from a restaurant, allowing customers to know what to eat ahead of time.
